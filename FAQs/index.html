          <h1 id="Who-is-it-for"><a href="#Who-is-it-for" class="headerlink" title="Who is it for?"></a>Who is it for?</h1><p>To any qualified healthcare professional who is in an extreme situation with a shortage of assisted ventilators and needs a device of last resort that automates an AMBU type manual resuscitator, usually found in ambulances.<br>This device can be built in a short time and with readily available materials. It is a device designed to avoid life and death situations in emergency triages, not to replace other superior, professional and much safer devices.</p>
<h1 id="Who-can-build-an-OxyGEN-prototype-and-how-long-does-it-take"><a href="#Who-can-build-an-OxyGEN-prototype-and-how-long-does-it-take" class="headerlink" title="Who can build an OxyGEN prototype and how long does it take?"></a>Who can build an Oxy<strong>GEN</strong> prototype and how long does it take?</h1><p>Oxy<strong>GEN</strong> is designed to be very easy to build in emergency situations. No specialized engineering knowledge is required to build it. You can build one in less than 1 day, by yourself. The necessary tools can be found <a href="https://github.com/ProtofyTeam/OxyGEN" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<h1 id="OxyGEN-Replaces-a-certified-or-professional-respirator"><a href="#OxyGEN-Replaces-a-certified-or-professional-respirator" class="headerlink" title="OxyGEN Replaces a certified or professional respirator?"></a>Oxy<strong>GEN</strong> Replaces a certified or professional respirator?</h1><p>No, this is an emergency and last resort device. It is not a solution to replace professional artificial respirators. It is an emergency solution during extreme situations when there is no other option.</p>
<h1 id="Is-it-safe"><a href="#Is-it-safe" class="headerlink" title="Is it safe?"></a>Is it safe?</h1><p>It is a device of last resort that automates an AMBU manual respirator, commonly found in ambulances. It replaces the person who needs to carry out the compressions of the device, to free resources in saturation situations where there is no other alternative. It must be used under the imperative supervision of qualified health personnel. An improperly used respirator can be very dangerous.</p>
<h1 id="Is-it-legal"><a href="#Is-it-legal" class="headerlink" title="Is it legal?"></a>Is it legal?</h1><p>We do not intend to build this device to sell or deliver it to anyone.<br>We just want to help in this global health emergency situation with a cheap, easy and quick to build device that can be used as a last resort for emergency situations in places where there is no other option. We only provide the design, plans and schematics, as well as our experience building this prototype.</p>
<h1 id="How-I-can-help"><a href="#How-I-can-help" class="headerlink" title="How I can help?"></a>How I can help?</h1><p>Oxy<strong>GEN</strong> is an opensource and free project, you can make forks or add new ideas as long as it is kept open and free for any citizen of the world.</p>
<h1 id="Who-is-behind-OxyGEN"><a href="#Who-is-behind-OxyGEN" class="headerlink" title="Who is behind OxyGEN?"></a>Who is behind Oxy<strong>GEN</strong>?</h1><p>Oxy<strong>GEN</strong> is a collaborative hardware project started and led by <a href="https://protofy.xyz" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Protofy</a>. Anyone can contribute ideas, plans or knowledge. You can contact us at <a href="mailto:oxygen@protofy.xyz">oxygen@protofy.xyz</a>.</p>
<h1 id="What-is-Protofy"><a href="#What-is-Protofy" class="headerlink" title="What is Protofy?"></a>What is Protofy?</h1><p><a href="https://protofy.xyz" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Protofy</a> is a company located in Barcelona that supports innovation with hardware and software to companies and engineering departments.</p>
<h1 id="What-inspires-and-motivates-us"><a href="#What-inspires-and-motivates-us" class="headerlink" title="What inspires and motivates us?"></a>What inspires and motivates us?</h1><p>The will to contribute our knowledge to alleviating the devastating effects of this unprecedented health crisis in recent years. This pandemic can lead to situations of shortage and lack of medical equipment and supplies in some places (rural areas, developing countries) if the situation worsens.</p>
<h1 id="Isn’t-this-exaggerated-Is-this-really-necessary-There-will-be-no-shortage"><a href="#Isn’t-this-exaggerated-Is-this-really-necessary-There-will-be-no-shortage" class="headerlink" title="Isn’t this exaggerated? Is this really necessary? There will be no shortage!"></a>Isn’t this exaggerated? Is this really necessary? There will be no shortage!</h1><p>We do not know if this is necessary, and we hope that it is not. We have decided to build it and release and share the plans and design for anyone to build. We hope that this is never necessary, and that medical services in all countries of the world will have access to the devices they need. However, we think that if the situation worsens, there may not be enough respirators in numerous places.</p>
<h1 id="Is-OxyGEN-a-certified-medical-device"><a href="#Is-OxyGEN-a-certified-medical-device" class="headerlink" title="Is OxyGEN a certified medical device?"></a>Is Oxy<strong>GEN</strong> a certified medical device?</h1><p>No, Oxy<strong>GEN</strong> is an open hardware project. It should only be built for emergency situations, and should always be operated by qualified personnel and under medical supervision.</p>
